Major Arcana archetype frames where this energy lives; in practice, that means working directly with your core theme and letting small, steady actions accumulate. Keep language simple, plans modest, and accountability gentle but consistent. If doubt appears, return to facts: what you tried, what happened, and what you learned. Celebrate progress out loud. Invite help where it will meaningfully reduce friction. This is not about perfection—it is about traction. Next step: write one sentence to define the outcome you want, choose a single action that moves it forward today, and schedule a review time. Keep it human‑sized.
